<p id="hammer-p">In the later medieval era, well after the end of the Viking age, armored knights used war hammers. The head of a 15th century war hammer is shown to the left.

These weapons were optimized for damaging the joints of plate armor, reducing the mobility of an opponent, and making it easier to get past his plate armor defenses. The photo to the right shows the knight on the left using a war hammer for an overhead parry.</p>



 <p id="hammer-p2">To be struck with something other than a weapon was an insult and a humiliation in Viking society. The shame was magnified if the blow also caused some other form of disgrace, such as soiling the clothes. In chapter 28 of Grettis saga, Auðun flung a skin sack filled with curds at Grettir, striking him and covering him with curds. Grettir considered it a greater insult than if Auðun had given him a bloody wound.

In chapter 32 of Finnboga saga ramma, Svartur, a herdsman, was armed only with a manure rake. As Jökull thrust with his spear, Svartur broke the spearshaft with his rake. Svartur threatened to land the second blow on Jökull's ear, which would have caused the greatest possible shame to Jökull.
