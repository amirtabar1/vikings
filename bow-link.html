<p id="viking-p5">viking bow</p>

<p id="bow-p">Bows were used primarily for hunting, but they were also used in battle in situations where men desired to target their opponents from a long distance away. In mass battles, archers opened the action before the opposing sides closed to fight at close range.

<p id="bow-p2">
Perhaps the most notable use of a bow in the sagas is Gunnar's single-handed defense at his home, Hlíðarendi (right), against an attack led by Gizurr hvíti, told in chapter 77 of Brennu-Njáls saga. From a loft in the upper level of the house, Gunnar used his bow to kill or wound ten of his opponents before his bow string was cut by one of the attackers.

<p id="bow-p3">Bows were used in nautical battles. Once engaged, men on opposing ships fired arrows and threw missiles from one ship to the other, attempting to clear the decks of men so that the ship could be taken. Chapters 106-111 of Ólafs saga Tryggvasonar describes the sea battle at Svölðr in the year 1000, in which King Ólafr was killed.

<p id="bow-p4">Bows in the Viking Age were made from a single piece of ‘D’ section wood, usually yew if available [Halpin 2008]:p.40-41 (Dublin, Hedeby, Wassenaar), but elm (Dublin, Hedeby) and even scots pine (Dublin) were also used. Bow varied in strength up to around 100lbs (Hedeby).
Bows were made by working down a wooden stave so that the heartwood formed the bulk of the bow, giving it its strength, while a layer of sapwood was retained along the bow’s back to give the bow more elasticity under tension and to help prevent it from breaking.
Many of the bows were extremely simple and we have a number of finds of bows that still have the bumps and branch accretions left from the removed branches along their backs (Wassenaar, Hedeby). </p>
